# Synctools

Synctools was originally designed as the backend to [Syncmrt](https://github.com/stylekilla/syncmrt).
However, in recent developments, Synctools has been absorbed into Syncmrt and thus this repository is no longer supported.
Please see https://github.com/stylekilla/syncmrt for the current updates on image guidance for synchrotron radiotherapy.
